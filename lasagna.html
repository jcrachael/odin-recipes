        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until softened. Add in the garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with the end of your spoon, until browned.</li>
            <li>Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with desired amount of salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 teaspoon each) and sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes, occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is tender.</li>
            <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
